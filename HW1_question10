HOMEWORK-1   QUESTION-10




10. Write a C program which prompts the user to input a year, 
"y". Your program should have a function that checks if 
the year "y" is a leap year or not using if-else conditions 
(A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years 
which are not divisible by 400). The function should return 1 
if it's a leap year and return 0 if it's not. Based on 
the output from this function, your main function should print 
"y is a leap year" or "y is not a leap year".




#include <stdio.h>



int is_leap_year(int y) {
    if (y % 4 == 0) {               //year is divisible by 4
        if (y % 100 == 0) {         //if it's divisible by 100
            if (y % 400 == 0) {     //must be divisible by 400
                return 1;
            } else {
                return 0; 
            }
        } else {
            return 1;
        }
    } else {
        return 0; 
    }
}

int main() {
    int year;

    printf("Enter a year: ");     // Ask the user to input a year
    scanf("%d", &year);

    if (is_leap_year(year)) {                                          
        printf("%d is a leap year.\n", year);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a leap year.\n", year);
    }

    return 0;
}
